# Software Development Interpreter Project

## Overview
#### The following is an assignment from the Fall 2020 semester. The infrastructure of the program (general flow, base abstract classes) was created by our instructor, and students were responsible for implementing statement/expression logic and writing tests. 

## Interpreter
#### For this project, the custom language deals only in integer values. The program takes in a text file as an argument(tests provided in repository) written in this "language" to be converted into executable statements and run by the interpreter.

## Supported Functionality
#### The interpreter supports: 
####variable declaration, function declaration/invocation, nested function calls, recursion, arithmetic expressions evaluable at runtime, flow control (if statements, loops, return)
