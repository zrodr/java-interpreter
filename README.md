# Software Development Interpreter Project

## Overview
#### The following is an assignment from the Fall 2020 semester. The infrastructure of the program (general flow, base abstract classes) was created by our instructor, and students were responsible for implementing statement/expression logic and writing tests. 

## Supported Functionality
#### The interpreter supports: 
-variable declaration 
-function declaration/invocation
-arithmetic expressions
-flow control (if statements, loops, return)

## Interpreter
#### The custom language deals only in integer values. The program takes in a text file as an argument(tests provided in repository) to be converted into executable statements and run by the interpreter. The interpreter maintains a call stack, so nested function calls and recursion are supported.
